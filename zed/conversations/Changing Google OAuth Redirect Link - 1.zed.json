However, I can guide you through the steps to change your Google OAuth2 redirect URL. If you can provide a link to your repository (if it’s public) or relevant code snippets/configuration, I can offer more specific help. \n\nIn general, to update the Google OAuth2.0 redirect link, you’ll need to:\n\n1. Go to Google Cloud Console or Google API Console (https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials).\n2. Click “Credentials” in the left navigation bar.\n3. Select the OAuth 2.0 Client ID you’re using.\n4. Update or add the new redirect URIs under “Authorized redirect URIs.”\n5. Save the changes.\n\nIf your application code also specifies the redirect URI (for example, you might be passing a redirect URL when you create the OAuth2 client in your code), be sure to update it there as well.\n\nIf you share code snippets (removing any sensitive keys), I can give more specific guidance on exactly which part of your app or configuration to update.\nhow can i give you acces to my repository? i am new to this and am using zed editor on mac os \n\nI don’t have a personal GitHub account or a way to log in to private repositories, because I’m just a virtual assistant. However, there are still a few ways to share your code so I can take a look:\n\n(1) Make your repo public on GitHub, then share the link here.  \n   • If you haven’t used GitHub before, here’s a quick rundown:  \n     a. Create a (free) GitHub account at http://github.com.  \n     b. Click on “New” (or the “+” icon) to create a new repository.  \n     c. Give it a name, set it to “Public,” and click “Create repository.”  \n     d. On your local machine, open a terminal (Zed Editor has an integrated terminal or you can use the macOS Terminal) and navigate to your project folder.  \n     e. Run the commands GitHub displays under “Quick setup” (it’ll look like “git init,” “git commit,” “git remote add origin,” etc.).  \n     f. Finally, run “git push -u origin main” (or “master” depending on your setup).  \n   • Once it’s on GitHub, share the repository URL in this chat so I can see your code.\n\n(2) Share specific code snippets in this chat (removing any sensitive information like API keys).  \n   • Copy and paste the relevant parts of your OAuth setup or configuration.  \n   • This is often enough to let me help you figure out how/where to change the OAuth redirect URI.\n\n(3) Use a “gist” (GitHub Gist).  \n   • If you only want to share a few files or specific parts of your code, go to https://gist.github.com.  \n   • Paste your code into the text area.  \n   • Click “Create secret gist” if you want it to be “unlisted” but still shareable, or “Create public gist” if you’re okay with it being publicly visible.  \n   • Then share the gist link from your browser.\n\nIn any case, please remember to remove or replace sensitive data (API secrets, OAuth client secrets, etc.) with placeholders before you share the code, to avoid leaking credentials. Once I can see the relevant code or configuration, I’ll be happy to guide you on updating the Google OAuth redirect URI.\nhttps://github.com/fran-galic/EasyRent/tree/local this is the code i am working with.
