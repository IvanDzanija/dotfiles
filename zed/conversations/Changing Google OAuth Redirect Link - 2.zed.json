However, I can guide you through the steps to change your Google OAuth2 redirect URL. If you can provide a link to your repository (if it’s public) or relevant code snippets/configuration, I can offer more specific help. \n\nIn general, to update the Google OAuth2.0 redirect link, you’ll need to:\n\n1. Go to Google Cloud Console or Google API Console (https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials).\n2. Click “Credentials” in the left navigation bar.\n3. Select the OAuth 2.0 Client ID you’re using.\n4. Update or add the new redirect URIs under “Authorized redirect URIs.”\n5. Save the changes.\n\nIf your application code also specifies the redirect URI (for example, you might be passing a redirect URL when you create the OAuth2 client in your code), be sure to update it there as well.\n\nIf you share code snippets (removing any sensitive keys), I can give more specific guidance on exactly which part of your app or configuration to update.\nhow can i give you acces to my repository? i am new to this and am using zed editor on mac os \n\nI don’t have a personal GitHub account or a way to log in to private repositories, because I’m just a virtual assistant. However, there are still a few ways to share your code so I can take a look:\n\n(1) Make your repo public on GitHub, then share the link here.  \n   • If you haven’t used GitHub before, here’s a quick rundown:  \n     a. Create a (free) GitHub account at http://github.com.  \n     b. Click on “New” (or the “+” icon) to create a new repository.  \n     c. Give it a name, set it to “Public,” and click “Create repository.”  \n     d. On your local machine, open a terminal (Zed Editor has an integrated terminal or you can use the macOS Terminal) and navigate to your project folder.  \n     e. Run the commands GitHub displays under “Quick setup” (it’ll look like “git init,” “git commit,” “git remote add origin,” etc.).  \n     f. Finally, run “git push -u origin main” (or “master” depending on your setup).  \n   • Once it’s on GitHub, share the repository URL in this chat so I can see your code.\n\n(2) Share specific code snippets in this chat (removing any sensitive information like API keys).  \n   • Copy and paste the relevant parts of your OAuth setup or configuration.  \n   • This is often enough to let me help you figure out how/where to change the OAuth redirect URI.\n\n(3) Use a “gist” (GitHub Gist).  \n   • If you only want to share a few files or specific parts of your code, go to https://gist.github.com.  \n   • Paste your code into the text area.  \n   • Click “Create secret gist” if you want it to be “unlisted” but still shareable, or “Create public gist” if you’re okay with it being publicly visible.  \n   • Then share the gist link from your browser.\n\nIn any case, please remember to remove or replace sensitive data (API secrets, OAuth client secrets, etc.) with placeholders before you share the code, to avoid leaking credentials. Once I can see the relevant code or configuration, I’ll be happy to guide you on updating the Google OAuth redirect URI.\nhttps://github.com/fran-galic/EasyRent/tree/local this is the code i am working with. I am trying to redirect to googles account selection page but i currently have this hardcoded in inside Front/src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx on line 152 href=\"http://127.0.0.1:8000/accounts/google/login/?next=/\" but i want to generate my own keys and redirect to that page.\n\nBelow is a step-by-step guide on how to (1) generate your own Google OAuth2.0 credentials, (2) configure those credentials in your Django backend (assuming you’re using Django Allauth or similar), and (3) clean up your hard-coded frontend link. I’ll reference your specific repository structure where relevant.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1) Create a Google Cloud project & OAuth credentials\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n1. Go to the Google Cloud Console:\n   https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials\n2. If prompted, select or create a new project.\n3. Under \"Credentials,\" click \"Create credentials\" → \"OAuth client ID.\"\n4. When prompted for Application type, select \"Web application.\"\n5. Enter a name (e.g., \"EasyRent Dev\").\n6. In \"Authorized redirect URIs,\" add your callback URL.  \n   - If you’re using Django Allauth defaults and your site runs at http://127.0.0.1:8000, you’ll likely need something like:  \n     http://127.0.0.1:8000/accounts/google/login/callback/  \n   - Since your existing code is hitting /accounts/google/login/?next=/, Django Allauth generally redirects from /accounts/google/login to the callback.  \n   - Make sure your exact callback path in Django is listed here.\n7. Click \"Create.\" Google will now show you a Client ID and a Client Secret.\n\nBe sure to copy or download these values—they’re your private credentials for Google OAuth. You’ll need them in your Django settings.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2) Configure Django to use your new OAuth credentials\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nYour repo suggests you might be using Django Allauth or something similar (because of /accounts/google/login). If so, find your Django settings where you configure Social Account Providers. For example, look for something like:\n\n    # Example in settings.py (or a separate allauth config file)\n    SOCIALACCOUNT_PROVIDERS = {\n        \"google\": {\n            \"SCOPE\": [\n                \"profile\",\n                \"email\"\n            ],\n            \"AUTH_PARAMS\": {\n                \"access_type\": \"online\"\n            },\n            \"APP\": {\n                \"client_id\": \"YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID\",\n                \"secret\": \"YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET\",\n                \"key\": \"\"\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\nReplace YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID and YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET with the values you just generated. Make sure your callback URL (in Step 1 above) matches whatever Django expects. By default, django-allauth uses /accounts/google/login/callback/ behind the scenes.\n\nIf you aren’t using django-allauth, you might be using python-social-auth or a custom solution. In that case, you’ll need to plug your credentials into the relevant configuration for that library. Either way, the important part is that the redirect URI you set in Google Cloud Console must match the actual callback/webhook route your app uses.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3) Update the hard-coded frontend link\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nIn your file Front/src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx around line 152, you have:\n\n    href=\"http://127.0.0.1:8000/accounts/google/login/?next=/\"\n\nThat’s a direct link to your Django Allauth (or similar) sign-in endpoint. If you plan to keep your local dev server at 127.0.0.1:8000, you can still use this URL. However, you might not need to hard-code the protocol/host if your frontend and backend are on the same domain. You could, for instance, do something like:\n\n    <a href=\"/accounts/google/login/?next=/\">Sign in with Google</a>\n\nBut if your frontend is served on a different port (e.g., 3000 for Next.js), you may need to keep the absolute URL. Once you deploy to production, you’ll likely change this link to your real domain anyway.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4) Verify that your redirect flow works\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n• In the browser, go to your frontend login page.  \n• Click \"Sign in with Google.\"  \n• You should be taken to Google’s account selection screen (assuming your client_id and redirect URIs are set up correctly).  \n• After authenticating, Google will redirect you back to your Django app’s callback endpoint, which should then log you in and send you to the next page (the “/” or wherever you specified).\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n5) Don’t forget about environment variables\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nFor security, do NOT store your client secrets directly in your GitHub repository code. In Django, you may do something like this instead:\n\n    # settings.py\n    import os\n\n    SOCIALACCOUNT_PROVIDERS = {\n        \"google\": {\n            \"SCOPE\": [\"profile\", \"email\"],\n            \"AUTH_PARAMS\": {\"access_type\": \"online\"},\n            \"APP\": {\n                \"client_id\": os.environ.get(\"GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID\"),\n                \"secret\": os.environ.get(\"GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET\"),\n                \"key\": \"\"\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\nThen, set your GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID and GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET in a private .env file or in your hosting environment variables (for production), so they’re not visible in your public GitHub repo.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nWrapping Up\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nIn summary, you will:  \n1) Create new OAuth credentials in the Google Cloud Console (be sure to add the correct callback URL).  \n2) Update your Django settings (Allauth or otherwise) with the new client_id and client_secret.  \n3) Replace your hard-coded link in the frontend with whichever URL you’ll be using for Google sign-in (either a relative path if you’re on the same domain or an absolute path if your frontend and backend differ).  \n4) Make sure everything lines up: the domain and path in “Authorized redirect URIs” must match the actual callback in your Django code.\n\nOnce that’s done, your sign-in flow should properly redirect to Google’s account selection page, and after authentication, return users to your Django app. If you run into errors, Google’s error messages often reveal that “the redirect URI is not authorized,” which usually means the URI in Google Cloud Console does not exactly match the URI your app is sending. Double-check spacing, trailing slashes, etc.\n\nIf you have follow-up questions or run into a specific error in the flow, feel free to let me know!\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":488}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":31},"start":108,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":489}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":32},"start":1129,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":490}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":100},"start":1225,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":491}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":101},"start":3305,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":492}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":478},"start":3665,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":493}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":479},"start":11568,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":494}}}],"summary":"Changing Google OAuth Redirect Link","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
